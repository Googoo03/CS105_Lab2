Many students focus exclusively on the _encoding_ process---that is, how to get the knowledge into memory in the first place. For example, taking notes is an activity for encoding knowledge.\n","\n","_Retrieval_, on the other hand, is the process of reconstructing that knowledge from memory. [Karpicke and Blunt](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/331/6018/772) (2011) demonstrated that _retrieval_ is more effective for learning than activites designed to promote effective encoding. They conducted an experiment in which subjects had to learn about sea otters by reading a passage. Subjects were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: some were instructed to create a [concept map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept_map) as they read the passage, while others were instructed to practice retrieval (i.e., read the passage, recall as much as they could, read the text again, and recall again). The two main measurements they recorded were:\n","\n","1. each subject's score on a follow-up learning test one week later\n","2. each subject's _prediction_ of how well they would do on that test\n","\n","In this lab, you will analyze data from a _replication_ of Karpicke and Blunt's experiment, conducted by Buttrick _et al_.\n","- The data file is : data.csv.\n","- The codebook (explaining what the variables mean) is : codebook.csv."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":1000},"id":"aA3QAljEvAlO","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1698194064973,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":206,"user":{"displayName":"Taghreed Alanazi","userId":"06155444049001084104"}},"outputId":"36d7098f-59f5-4cbc-c12c-019387144806"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["      ID  Age  Gender   Date.P1   Date.P2  Condition  IC.1  IC.2  Comp.1  \\\n","0    KB1   18  Female  11/21/16  11/28/16    Concept     1     1       1   \n","1    KB2   18    Male  11/21/16  11/28/16    Concept     1     1       1   \n","2    KB3   18    Male  11/21/16  11/28/16    Concept     1     1       1   \n","3    KB4   19  Female  11/21/16  11/28/16    Concept     1     1       1   \n","4    KB5   19  Female  11/22/16  11/29/16    Concept     1     1       1   \n","5    KB6   19    Male  11/22/16  11/29/16    Concept     1     1       1   \n","6    KB7   18    Male  11/22/16   12/6/16    Concept     1     1       1   \n","7    KB8   20    Male  11/22/16  11/29/16    Concept     1     1       1   \n","8    KB9   20    Male  11/22/16  11/28/16    Concept     1     1       1   \n","9   KB10   20  Female  11/29/16   12/6/16    Concept     1     1       1   \n","10  KB11   21  Female  11/21/16  11/28/16  Retrieval     1     1       1   \n","11  KB12   18  Female  11/21/16  11/29/16  Retrieval     1     1       1   \n","12  KB13   20  Female  11/21/16  11/28/16  Retrieval     1     1       1   \n","13  KB14   19  Female  11/21/16  11/28/16  Retrieval     1     1       1   \n","14  KB15   18  Female  11/22/16  11/29/16  Retrieval     1     1       1   \n","15  KB16   19    Male  11/22/16  11/29/16  Retrieval     1     1       1   \n","16  KB18   20    Male  11/22/16  11/29/16  Retrieval     1     1       1   \n","17  KB19   21  Female  11/29/16   12/6/16  Retrieval     1     1       1   \n","18  KB20   17    Male  11/29/16   12/6/16  Retrieval     1     1       1   \n","19  KB21   20    Male  11/29/16   12/6/16    Concept     1     1       1   \n","20  KB22   18    Male  11/29/16   12/6/16    Concept     1     1       1   \n","21  KB23   21    Male  11/29/16   12/6/16    Concept     1     1       1   \n","22  KB24   18    Male  11/29/16   12/6/16    Concept     1     1       1   \n","23  KB25   19    Male  11/29/16   12/6/16    Concept     1     1       1   \n","24  KB26   18  Female  11/29/16   12/6/16    Concept     1     1       1   \n","25  KB27   18    Male  11/29/16   12/6/16    Concept     1     1       1   \n","26  KB28   18    Male  11/29/16   12/2/16    Concept     1     1       1   \n","27  KB29   19    Male   1/23/17   1/31/17    Concept     1     1       1   \n","28  KB30   18  Female   1/23/17   1/31/17    Concept     1     1       1   \n","29  KB31   19  Female   1/23/17    2/1/17    Concept     1     1       1   \n","30  KB32   18    Male   1/23/17   1/31/17    Concept     1     1       1   \n","31  KB33   21    Male   1/24/17   1/31/17    Concept     1     1       1   \n","32  KB34   22  Female   1/24/17   1/31/17  Retrieval     1     1       1   \n","33  KB35   19    Male   1/24/17    2/2/17  Retrieval     1     1       1   \n","34  KB37   20    Male   1/24/17   1/31/17  Retrieval     1     1       1   \n","35  KB38   19  Female   1/24/17   1/31/17    Concept     1     1       1   \n","36  KB39   19  Female   1/25/17    2/1/17    Concept     1     1       1   \n","37  KB40   20  Female   1/25/17    2/2/17  Retrieval     1     1       1   \n","38  KB41   19  Female   1/25/17    2/1/17  Retrieval     1     1       1   \n","39  KB42   19  Female   1/25/17    2/1/17  Retrieval     1     1       1   \n","40  KB43   18  Female   1/25/17    2/1/17  Retrieval     1     1       1   \n","41  KB44   20    Male   1/25/17    2/1/17    Concept     1     1       1   \n","42  KB45   19  Female   1/26/17    2/2/17  Retrieval     1     1       1   \n","\n","    Comp.2  ...
